done

- floating and layering
- liquid density swap
- solid/liquid materials interaction (float and sink)
- ui fps/particle count
- temperature, force, etc overlays
- state change (evaporation, sublimation)
- new renderer
  - bloom
  - texture
- build mode
- heat/cool sources
- particle sources/sinks

to improve:

- worldtexture rgba32f

* gas behaviour
* different materials friction/behaviour
  - exponential rather than linear - materials are too similar

bugs:

- reset button
- ice should float
- ambient heat transfer with material only works one side (heat no cold)

todo major:

- materials interaction (mix)
- dynamic particles
- rigid bodies

todo minor:

- draw heater/cooler
- Diagonal and vertical liquid pressure model.
- background
- play the level
