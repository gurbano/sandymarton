done

- XXX - floating and layering
- liquid density swap
- solid/liquid materials interaction (float and sink)
- ui fps/particle count

to improve:

- different materials friction/behaviour
  - exponential rather than linear - materials are too similar

bugs:

- click through ui

todo:

- gas behaviour
- materials interaction (mix)
- dynamic particles
- temperature, force, etc overlays
- new renderer
  - bloom
  - texture
  - background
