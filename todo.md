done

- floating and layering
- liquid density swap
- solid/liquid materials interaction (float and sink)
- ui fps/particle count
- temperature, force, etc overlays
- state change (evaporation, sublimation)
- new renderer
  - bloom
  - texture

to improve:

- gas behaviour
- different materials friction/behaviour
  - exponential rather than linear - materials are too similar

bugs:

- reset button
- ice should float

todo:

- build mode
- draw heater/cooler
- heat/cool sources
- dynamic particles
- materials interaction (mix)
  - background
- play the level
