# Assistant Workflow Notes

These notes capture the expectations for future documentation updates when collaborating in this repository.

1. Read the baseline commit from `.docs` in the repo root. This commit represents the last revision where documentation was verified.
2. Diff the workspace against that commit. Review all changes and determine whether any documentation files (anything under `docs/` or other written references) require updates.
3. Apply the necessary documentation updates.
4. After updates are complete and verified, write the new `HEAD` commit hash back to `.docs`.

When you need me to follow this process, simply mention these assistant notes so I can reload them.
